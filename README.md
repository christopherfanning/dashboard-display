# Dashboard Display
# ** WORK in Progress ** 

## The problem
The nest hub display lacks any customization options. 
* No date displayed on any of the clock faces.
* No button placement options for lighting controls.
* Interface is laggy
* Annoying Advertisements / Content suggestions (I'm not interested in reading news on the display)

## Solution
Build my own. Designed for a RaspberryPi with a small touch screen.

## Features I want
* Video doorbell integration (nest does this well)
* Lighting controls
* Informative clockface with the date, local weather, etc

## Other 3rd-party integrations 
* Twitter feed or other social alerts
* Github
* Calendar


## Tech stack
SpringBoot, with a fullscreen-able Angular frontend. 

## Todo
* Add script to gradle to build angular first
